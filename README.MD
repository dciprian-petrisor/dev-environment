# Dev Environment

The goal of this repository is to make it easy to set up a development environment anywhere, just how I prefer it.

I usually work in a Linux environment, however I prefer Windows for daily activities.

As such, this repository makes use of Vagrant and Ansible to set up a VM in Virtual Box with my preferred configuration.

## Vagrant set up instructions

1. Install Vagrant.
2. Run ```vagrant up --provider virtualbox``` from an admin console to initialize the VM.
